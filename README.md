## Introduction

If you are a student completing this executable examination as part of a class
at Allegheny College, you will need to modify the source code according to the
instructions inside of the five Python source code files in the `source/`
directory. If you have questions about this examination, please see the course
instructor during the examination time period. You must read and carefully all
of the instructions in this file before starting the executable examination.

## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this examination."

- You **must** adhere to the Honor Code throughout your completion of the examination
- You **must** answer all of the questions in the examination using your own source code
- You **may use** your laptop computer and its text editor and Python programming tools
- You **may not** use any Python programming tools available through online web sites
- You **may not** refer to the Python source code that you wrote during the semester
- You **may not** refer to the technical writing that you completed during the semester
- You **may not** refer to your notes, the course textbook or web site, or any online resources
- You **may not** discuss any aspect of the examination with anyone except the course instructor

**IMPORTANT**: All students in this course are obligated to adhere to the

this examination.

## Examination Overview

- The examination is out of a total of 100 percent, with an automatically reported percentage.
- You must provide answers to all these questions by typing in the five Python source code files.
- The final version of each Python source code file must be in your GitHub repository by the due date.
- You may run each of the five Python programs on your laptop by using the `python` command.
- You cannot run `gatorgrade` on your laptop due to the encrypted `gatograde.yml` file.
- The score for your examination is reported when a build takes place in GitHub Actions.
- Unless you already made special arrangements with the instructor, no late work will be accepted.
- The course instructor reserves the right to modify the grade reported through GitHub Actions.

## Examination Details

After cloning this repository to your computer, please recall these details about the examination:

- The instructions and source code for the five questions on the examination are in these files:
  - `question_one.py`
  - `question_two.py`
  - `question_three.py`
  - `question_four.py`
  - `question_five.py`
- For each file there are three sub-questions, denoted as `a`, `b`, and `c` in the provided Python source code.
- Following the instructions for each sub-question, you should provide the requested function(s) so as to ensure that they meet
  the specification. When you read the commented source code for each sub-question you will see examples of what output
  the requested function will produce when it is provided with the given input(s).
- Generally, the instructions for each sub-question will invite you to write, repair, or reorder the requested function.
- You can run the chosen question by typing one of the following commands from the root of this GitHub repository:
  - `python source/question_one.py`
  - `python source/question_two.py`
  - `python source/question_three.py`
  - `python source/question_four.py`
  - `python source/question_five.py`
- When you run a program in the terminal window using one of the aforementioned commands, each of the question's
  sub-questions will produce a single line of output. Since there are always three sub-questions, this means that
  running one of the aforementioned Python programs will always produce three lines of output.
- Using the comments in the source code as a guide, you can confirm that the programs are producing the expected output.
- After committing and pushing your code, you can review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions. If one
  of the functions is not producing the correct output and/or one of the GatorGrader checks is not passing correctly,
  you may make an unlimited number of re-attempts during the time designated for completing this executable examination.
- Please completely delete the `TODO` markers and their labels from all of the provided source code. This means that
  instead of only deleting the `TODO` marker from the code you should instead delete the `TODO` marker and the prompt
  and then add your own comments to demonstrate that you understand all of the source code in this examination.
